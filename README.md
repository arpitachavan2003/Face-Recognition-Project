# Face-Recognition-Project
**Description:**
This project focuses on face recognition using Seaborn for data visualization and SciPy for scientific computing. It involves image processing, feature extraction, and 
face identification techniques based on mathematical and statistical methods. The goal is to analyze facial features and recognize faces using computational techniques.
With the combination of Seaborn and SciPy, the project enables efficient data visualization and precise facial feature analysis. It also leverages additional libraries 
like NumPy for numerical operations and OpenCV for image handling.

**Technologies Used:**
The following technologies and libraries are used in this project:
1. Seaborn
2. SciPy
3. NumPy
4. OpenCV (Optional)
5. Matplotlib

**Installation:**
To set up the project environment, install the required dependencies using the following command:
pip install seaborn scipy numpy opencv-python matplotlib

If OpenCV is not required, you can install only the necessary libraries:
bash
pip install seaborn scipy numpy matplotlib

**Steps to Run the Project**
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/face-recognition-seaborn-scipy.git
cd face-recognition-seaborn-scipy
Install dependencies (as shown above).
Load and preprocess the dataset.
Use SciPy to extract and analyze facial features.
Visualize data using Seaborn.
Apply recognition algorithms for face identification.
